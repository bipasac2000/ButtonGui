1) Run OddServer.java
2) Run PrimeServer.java
3) Run FlyWeightButton.java

* In the console you can only see the print statements of OddServer.java. 
* However, if you run PrimeServer.java first you can only see print statements of PrimeServer.java. 
* I think this is just how the console works. I could be wrong.
